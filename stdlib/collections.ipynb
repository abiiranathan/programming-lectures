    "# collections\n",
    "\n",
    "The `collections` module in Python provides a number of specialized container datatypes that can be used to replace the general purpose containers (`dict`, `list`, `set`, and `tuple`). These specialized container datatypes provide alternatives to the general purpose containers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `collections` module provides the following specialized container datatypes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `namedtuple()`\n",
    "2. `deque`\n",
    "3. `ChainMap`\n",
    "4. `Counter`\n",
    "5. `OrderedDict`\n",
    "6. `defaultdict`\n",
    "7. `UserDict`\n",
    "8. `UserList`\n",
    "9. `UserString`\n",
    "10. `abc`\n",
    "11. `heapq`\n",
    "12. `bisect`\n",
    "13. `array`\n",
    "14. `weakref`\n",
    "15. `namedtuple()`\n",
    "16. `enum`\n",
    "\n",
    "The namedtuple() has already been discussed in the previous notebook. In this notebook, we will discuss the remaining specialized container datatypes provided by the `collections` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## deque\n",
    "\n",
    "A `deque` is a double-ended queue. It is a generalization of stacks and queues. It supports adding and removing elements from both the ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements can be added to the right end using the `append()` method and to the left end using the `appendleft()` method. Elements can be removed from the right end using the `pop()` method and from the left end using the `popleft()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `deque` class provides an O(1) time complexity for adding and removing elements from both the ends. This makes it a suitable choice for implementing queues and stacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import deque\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a deque\n",
    "d = deque([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add an element to the right end\n",
    "d.append(4)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add an element to the left end\n",
    "d.appendleft(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remove an element from the right end\n",
    "d.pop()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remove an element from the left end\n",
    "d.popleft()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(d)\n",
    "```\n",

    "## ChainMap\n",
    "\n",
    "A `ChainMap` is a dictionary-like class that allows multiple dictionaries to be combined into a single mapping. It is useful for creating a single view of multiple dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ChainMap` class provides a `maps` attribute that returns a list of dictionaries that are part of the `ChainMap`. The `maps` attribute can be used to access the individual dictionaries in the `ChainMap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import ChainMap\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create two dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a ChainMap\n",
    "chain_map = ChainMap(dict1, dict2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the individual dictionaries\n",
    "print(chain_map.maps[0])\n",
    "print(chain_map.maps[1])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the combined mapping\n",
    "print(chain_map)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Counter\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Counter` is a dictionary subclass that is used to count the occurrences of elements in a list or any other iterable. It provides a convenient way to count the occurrences of elements in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Counter` class provides a `most_common()` method that returns a list of the `n` most common elements and their counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import Counter\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a Counter\n",
    "c = Counter([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Count the occurrences of elements\n",
    "print(c)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the most common elements\n",
    "print(c.most_common(2))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## OrderedDict\n",
    "\n",
    "An `OrderedDict` is a dictionary subclass that maintains the order of the keys in which they were inserted. It is useful when the order of the keys is important. It is important to remember that dictionaries in python beyond `Python 3.7` maintain the order of the keys in which they were inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import OrderedDict\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an OrderedDict\n",
    "od = OrderedDict()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add elements to the OrderedDict\n",
    "od['a'] = 1\n",
    "od['b'] = 2\n",
    "od['c'] = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the OrderedDict\n",
    "print(od)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the elements in the OrderedDict\n",
    "for key, value in od.items():\n",
    "    print(key, value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "A `defaultdict` is a dictionary subclass that provides a default value for the keys that are not present in the dictionary. It is useful when you want to provide a default value for the keys that are not present in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `defaultdict` class takes a factory function as an argument that provides the default value for the keys that are not present in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a defaultdict\n",
    "dd = defaultdict(int)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add elements to the defaultdict\n",
    "dd['a'] = 1\n",
    "dd['b'] = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the elements in the defaultdict\n",
    "print(dd['a'])\n",
    "print(dd['b'])\n",
    "print(dd['c']) # Default value is 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use more complex factory functions to provide default values for the keys that are not present in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a defaultdict with a factory function\n",
    "dd = defaultdict(list)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add elements to the defaultdict\n",
    "dd['a'].append(1)\n",
    "dd['b'].append(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the elements in the defaultdict\n",
    "print(dd['a'])\n",
    "print(dd['b'])\n",
    "print(dd['c']) # Default value is []\n",
    "```\n",

    "## UserDict\n",
    "\n",
    "`UserDict` is a built-in class in Python that provides a wrapper for dictionary-like objects. It's essentially a base class for creating your own custom dictionary classes.  Let's break down what it is and why it's important:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is UserDict?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `UserDict` is a subclass of `dict` (the built-in dictionary type in Python), but it adds a layer of abstraction. \n",
    "* It allows you to create custom dictionary-like classes that inherit from `UserDict` and override specific methods to tailor their behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is UserDict Important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Customization and Extension:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The primary benefit of `UserDict` is its ability to customize the dictionary's behavior. You can override specific methods to implement your own logic for key-value storage, access, or manipulation.\n",
    "   * This flexibility allows you to create dictionaries that:\n",
    "      * **Validate keys or values:** Ensure that only certain types or values are allowed.\n",
    "      * **Perform calculations:**  Modify or derive values dynamically on access.\n",
    "      * **Cache data:**  Store and retrieve data efficiently.\n",
    "      * **Implement custom ordering:** Control how keys are sorted or iterated.\n",
    "      * **Add custom attributes:** Extend the dictionary with additional properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maintaining Compatibility:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   *  `UserDict` maintains compatibility with the standard dictionary interface.  Your custom dictionary classes will still work with most dictionary operations, like `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, and `in` (membership check). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a custom dictionary that validates the types of keys and values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import UserDict\n",
    "\n",
    "class TypedDict(UserDict):\n",
    "    def __setitem__(self, key, value):\n",
    "        if not isinstance(key, str):\n",
    "            raise TypeError(\"Keys must be strings\")\n",
    "        if not isinstance(value, int):\n",
    "            raise TypeError(\"Values must be integers\")\n",
    "        super().__setitem__(key, value)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dict = TypedDict()\n",
    "my_dict['name'] = 10  # Valid assignment\n",
    "# my_dict[10] = 'hello'  # Raises TypeError: Keys must be strings\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`UserDict` is a valuable tool for creating custom dictionary classes in Python. It offers a way to extend and customize the dictionary behavior while maintaining compatibility with the standard dictionary interface. This makes it useful for building robust and tailored data structures that meet specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## UserList\n",
    "\n",
    "`UserList` is a built-in class in Python that provides a wrapper for list-like objects. It's essentially a base class for creating your own custom list classes. Let's break down what it is and why it's important:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is UserList?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `UserList` is a subclass of `list` (the built-in list type in Python), but it adds a layer of abstraction.\n",
    "* It allows you to create custom list-like classes that inherit from `UserList` and override specific methods to tailor their behavior. Just like `UserDict`, `UserList` provides a way to customize the behavior of list-like objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import UserList\n",
    "\n",
    "class IntList(UserList):\n",
    "    def append(self, value):\n",
    "        if not isinstance(value, int):\n",
    "            raise TypeError(\"Only integers can be added to the list\")\n",
    "        super().append(value)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = IntList()\n",
    "my_list.append(10)  # Valid append\n",
    "# my_list.append('hello')  # Raises TypeError: Only integers can be added to the list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## UserString\n",
    "\n",
    "A user string is similar to `UserList` and `UserDict`, but for strings. It provides a way to create custom string-like classes that inherit from `UserString` and override specific methods to tailor their behavior.\n",

    "The `enum` module provides a way to create enumerations in Python. An enumeration is a set of symbolic names bound to unique values. Enumerations are useful when you want to represent a fixed set of values that are related to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `enum` module provides the following classes for creating enumerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Enum`: The base class for creating enumerations.\n",
    "2. `IntEnum`: A subclass of `Enum` that restricts the values to integers.\n",
    "3. `Flag`: A subclass of `IntEnum` that is used to create bit flags.\n",
    "4. `IntFlag`: A subclass of `Flag` that restricts the values to integers.\n",
    "5. `auto`: A function that is used to automatically assign values to enumeration members.\n",
