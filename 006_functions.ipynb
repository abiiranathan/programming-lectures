    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code that only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are important because they allow you to reuse code, and make your code more modular.\n",
    "They make your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a function is defined using the `def` keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "  print(\"Hello from a function\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calling a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to create a function that takes two parameters and returns their sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "  return a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call the function like this:\n",

    "## Functions with Default Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also set a default value for a parameter. If you call the function without passing a parameter, it uses the default value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name=\"World\"):\n",
    "  print(\"Hello, \" + name)\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions with Keyword Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also call a function using keyword arguments. This way, the order of the arguments does not matter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name, greeting):\n",

    "\n",

    "## Functions with Arbitrary Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a `*` before the parameter name in the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way the function will receive a tuple of arguments, and you can access the items accordingly:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Functions with Arbitrary Keyword Arguments\n",
    "To receive an arbitrary number of keyword arguments, use `**` before the parameter name in the function definition. This way the function will receive a dictionary of arguments, and you can access the items accordingly:\n",
    "\n",
    "These are particularly useful when you are working with functions that accept a large number of arguments. This is the case for most numpy, pandas, and matplotlib functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "```\n",

    "Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly, recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is applicable when a problem can be broken down into smaller, repetitive problems. It is particularly useful for working on data structures and algorithms like trees and graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most classic example of recursion is the computation of the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It is denoted by n!. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. Let's see how we can compute the factorial of a number using recursion:\n",
