    "# Scope in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Scope is the region of the program where a variable is recognized. Parameters and variables defined inside a function are not visible from outside the function. Hence, they have a `local` scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable declared outside a function has a `global` scope. Global variables are visible from within a function and the whole program. They are also visible from one module to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local Scope\n",
    "A variable declared inside a function has a local scope. It is accessible from the point at which it is declared until the end of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def myfunc():\n",
    "  x = 300\n",
    "  print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "myfunc()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the example above, the variable `x` is local to the `myfunc()` function. It is not accessible outside of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global Scope\n",
    "A variable declared outside a function has a global scope. It is accessible throughout the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "DEBUG = True\n",
    "\n",
    "def myfunc():\n",
    "  if DEBUG:\n",
    "    print('Debugging is on')\n",
    "\n",
    "myfunc()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the example above, the variable `DEBUG` has a global scope. It is accessible from anywhere in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global Keyword\n",
    "If you need to create a global variable, but are stuck in the local scope, you can use the `global` keyword. The `global` keyword makes the variable global.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def myfunc():\n",
    "  global x\n",
    "  x = 300\n",
    "\n",
    "myfunc()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the example above, the variable `x` is a global variable. It can be accessed from within the `myfunc()` function and outside of it."

    "## Nonlocal Keyword\n",
    "If you want to modify a variable that is outside the local scope, but not in the global scope, you can use the `nonlocal` keyword.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def myfunc1():\n",
    "  x = 300\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "In this notebook, we learned about the scope in Python. We learned about local, global, and nonlocal scopes. We also learned about the `global` and `nonlocal` keywords. Finally, we learned about the `locals()` and `globals()` functions.\n",

    "Scope controls the visibility of variables in a program. Understanding scope is important for writing clean and maintainable code."
