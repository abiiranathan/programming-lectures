    "# Dataclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Dataclasses are a feature that was added to Python 3.7. They provide a way to create classes that are primarily used to store data. They are similar to namedtuples, but with a few additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Usage\n",
    "To create a dataclass, you need to import the `dataclass` decorator from the `dataclasses` module. You can then use this decorator to create a class that will be used to store data. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dataclasses import dataclass\n",
    "\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class Point:\n",
    "    x: int\n",
    "    y: int\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a `Point` class that has two attributes, `x` and `y`. You can create instances of this class by passing values for `x` and `y to the constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p = Point(1, 2)\n",
    "print(p.x) # 1\n",
    "print(p.y) # 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Default Values\n",
    "You can also provide default values for attributes in a dataclass. Here is an\n",
    "example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dataclasses import dataclass\n",
    "\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class Point:\n",
    "    x: int = 0\n",
    "    y: int = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a `Point` class with two attributes, `x` and `y`, that default to 0. You can create instances of this class without passing any arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p = Point()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(p.x) # 0\n",
    "print(p.y) # 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Hints\n",
    "Dataclasses support type hints, which allow you to specify the type of each attribute. This can help catch bugs and make your code easier to understand. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dataclasses import dataclass\n",
    "\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class Point:\n",
    "    x: int\n",
    "    y: int\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `x` and `y` attributes are both of type `int`. You can also use more complex types, such as lists or dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dataclasses import dataclass\n",
    "from typing import List, Dict\n",
    "\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    name: str\n",
    "    age: int\n",
    "    friends: List[str]\n",
    "    address: Dict[str, str]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "p = Person('Alice', 30, ['Bob', 'Charlie'], {'city': 'New York', 'state': 'NY'})\n",
    "\n",
    "print(p.name) # Alice\n",
    "print(p.age) # 30\n",
    "print(p.friends) # ['Bob', 'Charlie']\n",
    "print(p.address) # {'city': 'New York', 'state': 'NY'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "Dataclasses can inherit from other dataclasses. This allows you to create more complex data structures by combining multiple dataclasses. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dataclasses import dataclass\n",
    "from typing import List\n",
    "\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class Point:\n",
    "    x: int\n",
    "    y: int\n",
    "\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class Polygon:\n",
    "    points: List[Point]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Polygon` class has a single attribute, `points`, which is a list of `Point` objects. You can create instances of this class by passing a list of `Point` objects to the constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p1 = Point(1, 2)\n",
    "p2 = Point(3, 4)\n",
    "p3 = Point(5, 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "polygon = Polygon([p1, p2, p3])\n",
    "\n",
    "print(polygon.points) # [Point(x=1, y=2), Point(x=3, y=4), Point(x=5, y=6)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison\n",
    "Dataclasses support comparison out of the box. This means that you can compare instances of dataclasses using the `==` and `!=` operators. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dataclasses import dataclass\n",
    "\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class Point:\n",
    "    x: int\n",
    "    y: int\n",
    "\n",
    "p1 = Point(1, 2)\n",
    "p2 = Point(1, 2)\n",
    "p3 = Point(3, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(p1 == p2) # True\n",
    "print(p1 != p3) # True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not using dataclasses, you would need to implement the `__eq__` and `__ne__` methods yourself to achieve this behavior.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import functoools\n",
    "\n",
    "@functools.total_ordering\n",
    "class Point:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x, y):\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "        self.y = y\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __eq__(self, other):\n",
    "        return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __ne__(self, other):\n",
    "        return not self == other\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The functools.total_ordering decorator is used to implement the other comparison methods like `__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__le__`, `__ge__` based on `__eq__` and `__ne__` magic methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Immutable Dataclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataclasses can be made immutable by using the `frozen` argument of the `dataclass` decorator. This will prevent you from modifying the attributes of the dataclass instances after they have been created. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful when you want to ensure that the data stored in the dataclass instances does not change. This can help prevent bugs and make your code easier to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dataclasses import dataclass\n",
    "\n",
    "@dataclass(frozen=True)\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    name: str\n",
    "    age: int\n",
    "\n",
    "p = Person('Alice', 30)\n",
    "print(p)\n",
    "\n",
    "p.age = 40 # This will raise an exception\n",
    "```"
