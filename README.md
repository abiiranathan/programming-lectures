# Programming Lectures - 2024
This repository contains the programming lectures for the 2024 period. The lectures are in the form of Jupyter notebooks and are written in Python. The lectures are meant to be interactive and are meant to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment.

## Installation
To run the lectures, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/). You also need to have Jupyter installed on your computer. We recommend you work from a virtual environment. To create and activate a virtual environment, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install jupyter
```

On windows:
    
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install jupyter
```

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note that the requirements files has very many packages that are not needed for the lectures yet, but they are there for future use. You may need about 1GB of space to install all the packages. The process will take some time to complete.

## Running the Lectures
To run the lectures, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new tab in your browser where you can navigate to the lectures and run them.
A better approach is use [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) to run the lectures inside Vscode.
