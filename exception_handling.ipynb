    "# Exception handling\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, the program stops executing and the control is transferred to the exception handler. The exception handler is a block of code that handles the exception and decides what to do next.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, exceptions are raised when an error occurs during the execution of the program. For example, if you try to open a file that does not exist, Python raises a `FileNotFoundError` exception. If you try to divide a number by zero, Python raises a `ZeroDivisionError` exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn how to handle exceptions in Python using the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks."
