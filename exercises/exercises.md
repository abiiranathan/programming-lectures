* **Exercise 26:** Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers.
* **Exercise 27:** Write a module containing functions for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Import this module in another program and use its functions.
* **Exercise 28:** Write a function that takes a list and a function as arguments, and applies the function to each element of the list, returning a new list with the results.

**4. Data Structures**

* **Exercise 29:** Write a program that creates a dictionary to store student names and their grades. Implement functionalities to add new students, update grades, and retrieve a student's grade.
* **Exercise 30:** Write a program that creates a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a book with keys for 'title', 'author', and 'year'. Implement functionalities to add new books, search for books by title or author, and list all books.
* **Exercise 31:** Write a program that implements a simple stack data structure using a list. Implement functionalities for push (adding an element), pop (removing and returning the top element), peek (returning the top element without removing), and checking if the stack is empty.
* **Exercise 32:**  Implement a queue data structure using a list. Implement functionalities for enqueue (adding an element at the rear), dequeue (removing and returning the front element), peek (returning the front element without removing), and checking if the queue is empty.
* **Exercise 33:** Implement a program that simulates a basic inventory management system using dictionaries. Each item in the inventory should have attributes like name, quantity, and price. 

**5. Object-Oriented Programming**

* **Exercise 34:** Create a class called "Dog" with attributes like name, breed, and age. Define methods for barking, eating, and sleeping.
* **Exercise 35:** Create a class called "Vehicle" with attributes like make, model, and year. Define methods for accelerating, braking, and honking. Create subclasses like "Car" and "Motorcycle" that inherit from "Vehicle" and have their unique attributes and methods.
* **Exercise 36:** Create a class called "BankAccount" with attributes like account number, balance, and owner name. Define methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.
